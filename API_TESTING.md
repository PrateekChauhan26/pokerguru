## Testing with Different Models

To test with AI intent detection, set `useAIIntent: true` in your requests:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Should I call with a flush draw?",
    "sessionId": "test-session-123",
    "useAIIntent": true
  }'
```

## Performance Testing

For load testing, you can use tools like Apache Bench:

```bash
# Test 100 requests with 10 concurrent connections
ab -n 100 -c 10 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -p test-data.json http://localhost:8000/chat/message
```

Where `test-data.json` contains:
```json
{
  "message": "What are pot odds?",
  "sessionId": "load-test"
}
```
